# Calculator App

This is a fully functional calculator app built from scratch using Flutter. The app handles all the backend logic, including converting infix expressions to postfix and evaluating postfix expressions, all implemented in Dart.

## Features

- **Infix to Postfix Conversion:** The app can convert standard infix mathematical expressions to postfix notation for easier computation.
- **Postfix Expression Evaluation:** Once the expression is converted, the app evaluates the postfix expression to give the final result.
- **Simple and Intuitive UI:** A clean and user-friendly interface that makes it easy to perform calculations.
